Two Kaggle datasets have been used for this project. They can be downloaded from links provided in the report. Upload both datasets to the same directory as the notebooks to get started.

The popularity dataset should have a folder full of csv files with the stock's symbol as the file name. A python script is provided to process and concatenate these files.

The script should create a single file that can be read in the notebooks and concatenated with price dataset under the data_preprocessing notebook.

Afterwards, the exploring_approach_visualization_baseline notebook should be run using the file created from the above notebook, which is a file that has our univer of stocks with robinhodd and price data.

All cells should be run in order. Most libraries and dependencies are included in the header cells, but some definitions may carry between cells, and certain libraries are imported further on in the notebooks.

Model implementations show examples (i.e. they sample single stocks from the main file). Examples of moving and exponential moving average are provided in the second notebook as well.
